push the state gets overwriteen with the length of the new arrqay,  push returned 
immutability of state in react,  used concat to achieve the resyult of adding an item to the end o af array in react state 

reserved prepend front prepend 





new array concat, old array intact, returns the changed arrya

concat new array leaving oÃ¸ld ontact, return changed array

concat push but twisth a twist 


wsolid 
solid data
top down 
with objects rendered together with the array we map utlising the unique keys from the item values, it endpoint from api 
all is connected and we make all into parse number values, anything outside unknown vlaue begins with 0, then we have our directed map id vlaue, we tthen direct our combinations with this, like and comment share same id endpoint









have localstorage parsse of make int o a number vlaue again

from localstrorage we have string vlaues 
make number agian on function rendder there is a number vlaue we now 


we have converted our string value into a numbers value and now our iteration array combined with the object mathced by it in our localstorage all solve the prolbem of likes together 
we have the perfect solution that is all we need for any array we have component props outside in parent component

we have the top level comment

we havethe function top level information
then we send it around 

our state value immediately find their counterparts going by matthinc id value from endpoint insdpired focus



then componet nad we have the state 


we n
and hter eis there is prop value 


likevalue

likevalue >= 


setAItem 

likevalueid
prop,.id

prop,.

prop.id


we have function that uses the state of top component then they remember any getitiem ekyvalue is a certain id key then value is like value we have the nubmervalue from a weird kye top state iteration map array




with the correct information as the array and the iteration of reusable and utilising hte mapped values from another component
we now have the irteration and the props top down uinfomration to allow an indpeendent reboulious componet toi have all information on in the fields, on everythign there is now a connnectio nopen component and have it use the vlaues of a paretn componetn all is connect we now have a utilization of acknoledgment
info becomes when a child ocmponent is imported,. then array tulisies our vlaue any value there is an addition 


we have seemingly had a big breakthrough, we now have swarms of customized recognisable auto like sets, however, lcoalstorage is reset to zero on each load, and our array items have to automatic states on load, cluttering any conditional renders from the prop leve inside of parent component

WTDRN

WHY is localstorage reset on each load
WTDRN STOP STOP



trash notes::


if a nubmer isnt calculated then a string has occoured

each component is independent, so domino effect are unrealted
there is something argumented for the value to change suddenly, there is a tip of balance in favour of nothignsnees in the ecosystem

something is setting state to null on refresh, what is forced to actionate on refresh


we removed the dislike variable  () => {}, all the same



















we have to save each like indivbidually and be able to acsess it individually

in the map iterator, we find that we acsess the individual values of the array we iterate through
here we can both setthe like to localstorage, on each state update
use as prop





top down information array iteratio nutlisies the information hiearchy wehre stupoendous amount of arryas with items have their properties exposed for the map iteration and anything is resuable and fit for hybdrid manuvaroubablity 

values are transcendent 


our important knowledge is here::: values like this append dynamci based on the iteratio nid from each endpoint:::
     function setDynamicLikeValue () { localStorage.setItem("likeValueID:" + prop.id + ":", likeValue)

    } //this ends the setDynamicLikeValue
    



         function setDynamicLikeValue () { localStorage.setItem("likeValueID:" + prop.id + ":", likeValue)

    } //this ends the setDynamicLikeValue
    



    we have now created a top level component that has the  state and props value to change and direct all of its servants

    there is now a liable value set that increases based ona resuable prop compoennt that holds a sawrm of any like set in any component tree

    there is now a controllable way of holdign any reaction and any set of information across all the specific items of an arrray


    each item from the array is treated individually by using a component that is exposed within the map iteration loop, the array vlaue utilises a reusable functio nthat changes props based on the iterated value from top down


    likevalue state expose has to resemble that of localstorage
